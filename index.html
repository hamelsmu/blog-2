I've created this blog because it's very easy to display interactive graphs. Which was necessary to show the Dutch Covid-19 trends per municipality. 
I'm considering to also post some of my previous projects, from new to old:

- [Kaggle housing competition, end result top 3%](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/discussion/170472)
- [Board game similarity](https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/collaborative-filtering-defining-similar-games)
- ['Wie is de Mol' prediction](https://medium.com/@jvanelteren/wie-is-de-mol-ontmaskerd-f4d98e06b3e4)
- [Flight visualizer](https://jvanelteren.github.io/blog/2020/04/22/flights_above_nl.html)
- Crypto arbitrage bot
- Plant recognizer
- Used car price prediction

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
